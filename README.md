### Smaller storyboards solve bigger problems

There are certain problems with big storyboards and here is the way you stay away from complexities.
## Pros:
- Multiple Views in one file, so organized.
- Navigation is very easy.
- You see the whole flow of the application at one place.

It looks too good to me as my stuff is more organized and everything is right there in one view. Cool isnâ€™t it? Yes, but only until the small project becomes large and this storyboard grows into a massive mess.

## Cons:
- More and more scenes in one storyboard creates a mess.
- Too many conflicts when working in a team

## How to Solve?
So, to get the best out of it, one way is to break down a big storyboard into smaller ones, thereby segregating the modules.

## Below is the link to my blog which describe the stuff in detail.
